1) Monotone colors! For now, I'm choosing gray, I want to try different layers of gray later on but I might be changing the colors. (not sure yet)

2) For font, I really like monospace font style - it looks simple, easy to read yet stylish.

3) I chose 3 photo from pexel, I'm aiming for a more aesthetic & minimalist feel for the website. So for now, these 3 photos seems to be the right fit for it.

4) Portfolio Examples I looked at from Google:

5) Wireframe: As I mentioned, I'm going for a more aesthetic and minimalist design so I plan to it short to minimize the usage of the scrollbar.

1) For colors, the theme is a cloudy day on the beach. I chose these colors because my favorite type of weather is cloudy and I find it very relaxing to go for a walk on the beach on a cloudy day. The colors sets a balance of cool and warm tone.

monotone trial color palette:
	
#234c64 - background
#849d9a - navigation bar
#b27a63 - div/footer/link
#c7ac8d - div
#fcf0d2 - text

update: after trying out the colors, I have decided to not pursue with the trial color palette choices.

new color palette:
#3D403A
#555954
#8FA6A1

I guess this color palette name title it still stay true to my "cloudy beach" theme. 

2) For font, I really like monospace font style - it looks simple, easy to read yet stylish.

3) I chose 2 photos from pexel and a few social media icons. I'm aiming for a more aesthetic & minimalist feel for the website. So for now, these photos seems to be the right fit for it.

5) Wireframe:I'm going for a more aesthetic and minimalist design so I plan to minimize the usage of the scrollbar.

Update: I made some changes to keep it simple so it does not look like the wireframe I drew. I tried having the nav bar in bottom of index.html but it didn't look good.

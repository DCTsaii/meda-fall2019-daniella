1) For colors, the theme is a cloudy day on the beach. I chose these colors because my favorite type of weather is cloudy and I find it very relaxing to go for a walk on the beach on a cloudy day. The colors sets a balance of cool and warm tone.

monotone trial color palette:
	
#234c64 - background
#849d9a - navigation bar
#b27a63 - div/footer/link
#c7ac8d - div
#fcf0d2 - text


2) For font, I really like monospace font style - it looks simple, easy to read yet stylish.

3) I chose 2 photos from pexel and a few social media icons. I'm aiming for a more aesthetic & minimalist feel for the website. So for now, these photos seems to be the right fit for it.
